## Design

### Typography

Choose fonts that reflect the Enigma machine's era and functionality. Consider using a monospaced font like "Courier" for simulating outputs and a readable font like "Roboto" for instructions and user interfaces.

### Color Scheme

The color palette is pivotal in creating an engaging user experience, drawing inspiration from the era of espionage and secret communications:

- Primary Text Color: A crisp off-white or cream color for main text provides excellent readability against darker backgrounds and minimizes eye strain during prolonged interactions.
- Secondary Text Color: Soft gray for secondary information or hints, ensuring they are distinguishable but not overpowering.
- Highlight and Interactive Elements: A muted gold or brass color an highlight interactive elements, user inputs, or key information, subtly nodding to the metallic elements of historical machinery.
- Error and Alert Messages: A muted red for errors or critical alerts draws attention without clashing with the overall aesthetic.

This design strategy aims to merge the thematic elements of your project with contemporary design principles, ensuring a user-friendly and immersive experience.
